        * Hunt Marketing emphasizes the universal importance of marketing, in business, but also in the lives of students, despite their major! The product, the 1st new Principles of Marketing product to be introduced in the past 10 years, was designed with an emphasis on student engagement and relevance, a focus embodied in these four key benefits:
       
* • A career focus, to help students understand how marketing will support whatever career path they choose and how to develop their own personal brand. Features like Career Tips,Executive Perspectives and Today’s Professional Interviews make marketing relevant and engaging for the student and can found in every chapter.




 • Integration of key topics that are part of the daily fabric of marketing― globalization, social media, ethics, and marketing analytics. These are covered THROUGHOUT the product and not in a single chapter.





   • Seamlessly integrated results-driven technology. Shane Hunt writes all of the Connect application exercises and teaches using Connect every year! The narrative and Connect content were developed side-by-side, allowing for seamless integration and continuity of coverage.







      • The right content for a semester-long course. Chapters are direct, concise,and approachable in length and written in an upbeat tone. In this newest edition, we have moved Personal Selling and Branding to earlier in the narrative.
